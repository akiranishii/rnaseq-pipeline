# MacLab End-to-End RNA-Seq Pipeline (Last updated: 07/23/2022)

## Introduction

The RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) pipeline processes sequencing data to estimate transcript abundance and identify differentially expressed transcripts across samples. There are various tools that can be used to achieve similar results, though this program will  make use of tools optimized for use in the MacDougald laboratory at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. 

## Extraction of Raw Sequences

The RNA-Seq pipeline supports the input of raw next-generation sequencing (NGS) data in the FASTQ format. The data can be directly obtained from RNA-seq experiments submitted to Illumina or the Beijing Genome Institute or it may be collected from public repositories. Many published NGS studies in the **Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)** provide direct links to the raw sequence data stored at the Sequence Read Archive (SRA). The sequence data from SRA normally requires decompression and, sometimes, proper splitting to generate the right FASTQ files.

Most sequencing data in the MacDougald lab are derived from Illumina and the Beijing Genome Institute (BGI). Before you look at the raw sequences, you should ask yourself the following questions:

1. What is the **animal model** used (e.g. human, mouse)?
2. Are the reads **paired-end or strand-specific**? If they are strand-specific, is it forward or reversely stranded?

## RNA-seq pipeline outline

The RNA-seq pipeline conducts three analyses in parallel. The first analysis uses STAR (v2.7.5a) for both the alignment and quantification procedures. The second analysis uses STAR (v2.7.5a) for alignment, then FeatureCounts for quantification. The final procedures uses Salmon (v0.11.30) for pseudoalignment. The result from the three analyses are compared after differential expression analysis is conducted. A more detailed outline of the RNA-seq pipeline can be viewed in the image below.

## Limitations of the RNA-seq pipeline

The MacLab RNA-seq pipeline was made with the most common use cases of RNA-seq in the MacDougald lab in mind. Therefore, the pipeline will not be able to conduct analyses in the following situations:

* The animal model is not human or mouse.
* The researcher is interested in identifying novel trascripts, rather than just identifying differentially expressed genes. 
* The researcher requires customizable plots.
* Adapters and low quality reads were not removed during the sequencing procedure (The UM Bioinformatics Core and BGI automatically conducts these procedures).
* The researcher is interested in controlling for batch effects or other variables (e.g. sex, age).

If any of the above procedures/analyses are required, please contact anishii@umich.edu with necessary product adjustments. 

## How to use the RNA-seq pipeline
The use of the RNA-seq pipeline requires four steps: (1) Obtaining all necessary files from GitHub, (2) Preparing input files for the RNA-seq pipeline, (3) Uploading all files onto the Great Lakes Server, and (4) Running the RNA-seq pipeline on the Great Lakes Server. All steps are outlined below. 

### STEP 1: Preparation of input files and download raw sequencing data

### STEP 2: Access the Great Lakes Server (https://arc.umich.edu/greatlakes/user-guide/)

1. Install the Cisco VPN client (https://its.umich.edu/enterprise/wifi-networks/vpn) and login using your level 1 password. You may need to fill out a form on the Great Lakes Server website to create an account if you do not have one already (https://arc.umich.edu/greatlakes/user-guide/).
2. Search â€œhttp://ssh uniqname@greatlakes.arc-ts.umich.edu" in the browser.
3. It will navigate you to a log in page. Use your level 1 account to access it.
4. Click files -> home directory.
5. Click "GO TO" on the navigation bar, and type the path "/nfs/turbo/umms-macdouga/" into it. Click ok.
6. Create a new directory for yourself. This directory will be referred to as [NEW DIRECTORY] in later steps.
7. Create a directory called "clean" inside [NEW DIRECTORY].
8. Upload all of your raw RNA-seq files (.fastq.gz) into the directory labeled "clean". Make sure each sample is placed in its own directory with a unique sample name that matches the sample name on the .csv file created in STEP 1. 

### STEP 3: Run RNA-seq analysis through the Great Lakes Server

1. Type the following into your terminal: `ssh [REPLACE WITH UNIQNAME]@greatlakes.arc-ts.umich.edu`
2. Use your level 1 account to login.
3. Navigate to new directory by typing the command: `cd /nfs/turbo/umms-macdouga/[NEW DIRECTORY]`
4. Load the git module onto the Great Lakes Server by using the command: `module load git`
5. Obtain the necessary programs from the RNA-seq pipeline using the command: `git clone https://github.com/akiranishii/rnaseq-pipeline.git`
6. Run the following commands in sequence to reorganize the files, as necessary for the pipeline: `mv -v rnaseq-pipeline/* .` `rm -r rnaseq-pipeline`
7. Run the analysis by using the command: `sbatch run_human_rna_seq` or `sbatch run_mouse_rna_seq` (ensure you choose the correct animal model)
8. To cancel a run, type the command: `scancel [insert Slurm Job ID]`
